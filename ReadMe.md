## Summary
Base code is the one found in reference link. From that, hand positions are calculated using the relation between points from right hand using the following diagram:

## Movement
* **Servo 1 (Left - Right):** Rotates depending on position of hand using as reference Palm center **"Point 9"**. Determines left or right position according to where in the frame the point is in X direction.
* **Servo 2 (Up - Down):** Moves depending on position of hand using as reference Palm center **"Point 9"**. Determines up or down position according to where in the frame the point is in Y direction.
* **Servo 3 (Reach):** Moves depending on distance between Wrist **"Point 0"** and **"Point 1"**. Determines stretch or contract according to how far is the hand form the camera.
* **Servo 4 (Open - Close):** Moves depending on distance between Wrist **"Point 0"** and Middle finger tip **"Point 12"**. Determines close or open position for gripper mirroring hand being open or closed.
